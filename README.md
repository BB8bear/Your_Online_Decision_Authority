## Eat, you must.
This app will choose a restaurant for the user to visit based on user input. Y.O.D.A. will allow the user to remove options from a food category list, and randomly select a restaurant for the user. 

Y.O.D.A. will make a call to Yelp's Fusion API and then return the nearest top rated restaurant in that category, based on user location.


## Stretch Goals
- Find user location based on GPS.
